    <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> <p>
                  Rohan Narayan built the OmniCrosswords app as
                  a Free app. This App is provided by
                  Rohan Narayan at no cost and is intended for use as
                  is. This app does not collect emails, names, or any other Personably Identifiable Information (PII).
                </p> <div><p>
                    The app does use third party services, namely to store crosswords. The app then fetches crosswords from this database to display to the user. No PII is collected in the database.

                  Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are

                  This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,
                  the app may use third party code and libraries that use
                  “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.
                  You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies
